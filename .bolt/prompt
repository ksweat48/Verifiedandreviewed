Design Philosophy
All designs must be beautiful, polished, and production-ready â€” never cookie-cutter or generic.

Prioritize clean, modern layouts with thoughtful visual hierarchy, responsiveness, and user experience.

Every UI section should feel purpose-built, not templated.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack Defaults
Use JSX syntax.

Style components using Tailwind CSS.

Use React hooks and standard React component patterns.

For icons and visual indicators, use Lucide React â€” no other icon libraries unless explicitly requested.

Do not install additional UI libraries or themes unless approved.
